# Issues

## Setup

Before working, fork and clone this repo and then do:

```shell
npm install
```

To run the unit tests that should guide your work do:

```shell
npm test
```

## Todo

Build out the `Issues` class inside `Issues.js` by completing the logic for its getter properties. The `Issues` class creates instances with a collection of GitHub Issues data and getter properties to access the data meaningfully.
